# Can't Connect to a Lobby in Cross Impact? - Last Updated December 17th, 2023 - 5:31 PM CST

If you find yourself stuck on "Joining Lobby," there might be a few reasons for this. Don't worry; we're here to help you troubleshoot the issue!

### 1. Same IP and Port as the Game:

- **Issue:** If you're attempting to connect two games running on the same computer, you might encounter this problem.
- **Solution:** Ensure that you are trying to connect to a game on a different device with a unique IP and port combination. Cross Impact cannot connect two instances running on the same machine.

### 2. Opponent Closed the Game:

- **Issue:** Sometimes, if your opponent closes their game after creating the lobby, the matchmaking server might not immediately recognize the closure.
- **Solution:** Double-check with your opponent to ensure their game is still open. If not, kindly ask them to restart the game and create a new lobby.

### 3. Blocked IP or Port **(MOST COMMON)**:

- **Issue:** The IP and port you're trying to connect to might be blocked, possibly due to firewall settings or another application using the same port.
- **Solution:**
  - **Firewall:** Ensure that your firewall is not blocking Cross Impact. You might need to create an exception for the game.
  - **Port Conflicts:** Check if any other application is using the same port. If so, either close that application or configure it to use a different port.

### 4. Connection Error: "Could not connect to the matchmaking server!"

If you receive the error "Could not connect to the matchmaking server!", consider the following possibilities:

- **WiFi Connection:** Check if your WiFi is functioning properly. A lack of WiFi connection could be the cause of the issue.
- **Firewall Settings:** Ensure that Cross Impact is allowed through Windows Firewall. Adjust your firewall settings to create an exception for the game.
- **Amazon's Server Maintenance:** If you're still facing issues, there might be ongoing maintenance on Amazon's servers, affecting the game's connectivity. If this is the case, we reccomend waiting until Amazon is finished or can get it back up and running. **(MOST COMMON)**:
- **Debug Browser Versions:** In rare cases, this error might be encountered in debug browser versions. If none of the above solutions work, consider trying a fresh install from Steam on Windows. Note that we can't guarantee the same for Mac or future ports.

### Additional Tips:

Sometimes, just restarting both clients or updating can randomly fix the issue. Cross Impact is in Early Access, and we're actively working on improvements every day.
