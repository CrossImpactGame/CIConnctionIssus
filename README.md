# Can't Connect to a Lobby in Cross Impact?

If you find yourself stuck on "Joining Lobby," there might be a few reasons for this. Don't worry; we're here to help you troubleshoot the issue!

### 1. Same IP and Port as the Game:

- **Issue:** If you're attempting to connect two games running on the same computer, you might encounter this problem.
- **Solution:** Ensure that you are trying to connect to a game on a different device with a unique IP and port combination. Cross Impact cannot connect two instances running on the same machine.

### 2. Opponent Closed the Game:

- **Issue:** Sometimes, if your opponent closes their game after creating the lobby, the matchmaking server might not immediately recognize the closure.
- **Solution:** Double-check with your opponent to ensure their game is still open. If not, kindly ask them to restart the game and create a new lobby.

### 3. Blocked IP or Port **(MOST COMMON)**:

- **Issue:** The IP and port you're trying to connect to might be blocked, possibly due to firewall settings or another application using the same port.
- **Solution:**
  - **Firewall:** Ensure that your firewall is not blocking Cross Impact. You might need to create an exception for the game.
  - **Port Conflicts:** Check if any other application is using the same port. If so, either close that application or configure it to use a different port.

### Additional Tips:

Sometimes, just restarting both clients or updating can randomly fix the issue. Cross Impact is in Early Access, and we're actively working on improvements every day. If you encounter connection issues, please let us know through our official channels so we can continue to enhance your gaming experience.

Thank you for your understanding and patience as we strive to make Cross Impact the best it can be!
